            Have I ever told you
I want you to the bone?

Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone
Oh, maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bones
And every corner in me, oh
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how I feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to
Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control, your body and soul

Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn't ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won't accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
'Cause maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah

Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control, your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Would you just take me home?

Hey, I want you to the bone

I want you to the bone, bone, bone, bone
I want you to the moon and backHave I ever told you
I want you to the bone?
Have I ever called you
When you are all alone?
And if I ever forget
To tell you how I feel
Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone
Oh, maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bones
And every corner in me, oh
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how I feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to
Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin'

I want you to the bone
Of all the ones that begged to stay
I'm still longing for you
Of all the ones that cried their way
I'm still waiting on you
Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn't ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won't accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
'Cause maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah
